	<h1> Clash of Clans </h1>

	<p> [Guest post]  I loved this game right away when I downloaded it 4 years ago.  The beginning of the game is very exciting, with the
         narrator telling you what to do next.  Here are some mistakes I made at the beginning that you can avoid.  With the new village
        that is available across the sea, I am planning on following the below tips in the new sea village.		 </p>
	<ol>
	<li> Don't waste gems on speeding up building.  In the beginning, I spent hundreds of gems to speed things up.  Save these gems to purchase defences and army.
         Building things in the beginning doesn't take long:  from 1 minute to 1 hours.	<br><br></li>
	<li>  My main strategy to this day is:  build and upgrade.  The more items you have in your village, and the higher their level  --  the more time it takes for
	      invaders to destroy them.  <br><br></li>
	<li>  My secondary strategy:  put defences inside walls.  Even better, if you have enough walls, wall in each defence individually.  This works along with my main strategy.
          The longer the invading troop are at your village, and the longer your defences survive, the more likely you are to defeat the invader.  <br><br></li>
	<li>  That said, I win about 50% of the attacks on my village.  I am currently level 107 with almost 300 trophies<br><br></li>
	<li> I also used my gems at the beginning to get two, then three then four builders.  At the beginning, I had more coins and elixir, and things were less costly.
         By about level 40, things get more costly, and instead of having all builders working, you only have 2 or 3.  This gets even worse around level 90.
         By level 107, I wait 10 days to save up 3 million coins to upgrade a defence.  At most I have 2 builders working at the same time.  Normally, only one. <br><br></li>
    <li> Now, I save up my gems to purchase expensive items, like X-bows, Eagle Artillery, Inferno Towers. <br><br></li>
	<li> Don't buy decorations:  they take away coins from buying defences and armies. <br><br></li>
	<li>  I really like the new sea village that is available.  It gives everyone a chance to start at the exciting beginning of the game again.<br><br></li>
	 </ol>


	<p>
	Enjoy!
