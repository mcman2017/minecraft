	<h1>Minecraft  in Survival mode Tutorial</h1>

	<p> Minecraft isn't a game of just skill, luck also plays a part.  Here
		I will tell you how to actually play the game </p>
		<p>  The first thing you need to do when playing in survival mode
  is get some wood.  You get it by holding it down.  Once it is removed
from the screen, look for it in your inventory.  If it is not there, get
closer to the wood and hold it down.  From your inventory, put the wood
in your craft: </p>

<p> The wood from the inventory becomes planks.  Once you have 4
	planks of wood, put them in each corner of your craft  --
	and you will make a crafting table: </p>
	<p>--picture of craft and a crafting table--<p>
<p>  Making a crafting table is very important.  You craft only has 4 spaces,
	but the crafting table has 9 spaces to combine ingredients.  With more spaces
	to combine more ingredients, you will be able to make more complex items
	that will help you later on. </p>
	<p>  To use the crafting table you need to put it down.  But you will need to
		build a shelter first before you put it down.  Look for three
		sheep and two cows  --  kill them all!  Now put your crafting table down
		and build a shelter with your remaining planks of wood.  You need a shelter
		to protect yourself at night from monsters.  If you run out of planks,
		get some more wood and make  more planks. Once inside your shelter,
	you can finally put down your crafting table.</p>
	<p>At this point, you might have noticed that you have been
	taking damage.  When this happens, quickly eat the food you got
by killing the sheeps and cows.  The damage you got is because
you are hungry.</p>
<h2>Using your crafting table</h2>
<p> Your crafting table should look like this</p>

<p>If you see a cave, quickly collect some stones and some coal.
Coal looks like this</p>
